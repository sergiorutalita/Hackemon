<h1>Patch 1.71 MiniPatch/Hot-Fix </h1> 
<ul>
 <li>Fixed a bug introduced in v1.7 that caused duplicating items and pokemons exclude/include lists which is beleived to cause freezes.</li>
  <li>Manual-Sniping input format now follows that of 'pokezz.com' : 'Pokemon latitude, longitude' e.g (Pikachu 48.935454, 2.328961) </li>
 <li>All Lists now are multi-interval selectable , you can press ctrl+A to select all or ctrl+click specific elements to highlight the corresponding and then you can apply a task on the selected element like '<' button would remove all selected.</li>
  <li>Fixed the taking-break minutes announced in log (it used to say the time for the next break and not the time for the current break)</li>
              
</ul>
<br><br>
 <h1>Patch 1.7 </h1> 
<ul>
               <li><b>Added the new 'SMART_MODE' walking mode which combines the benifits of both ROAD_FLY(Straight line) & ROAD_WALK (long valid roads) to come up with a unique solution of a short & human path at the same time.</b></li>
              
               <p align="center"><img src="http://puu.sh/qRQji/897d477e68.jpg" alt="hackemon"></p>

               <li>Fixed a lot of various issues that messes with the smoothness and effeciency of the bot (start/stop/relog sometimes used to get stuck , however this is not related to getting stuck on 'accepting level rewards'</li>
